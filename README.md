# springdemo


### 📱 Spring Boot SIM Module

This is a simple Spring Boot project demonstrating Dependency Injection (DI) using interfaces and their implementation classes.
It uses Airtel and Jio as examples of SIM providers injected into a Mobile component.

### 🚀 Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to understand how Spring Boot automatically manages dependencies and injects objects using the @Autowired annotation.

It follows a simple real-life scenario where:

A Mobile depends on a SIM to make calls and use data.

The SIM interface has two implementations: Airtel and Jio.

The Mobile class activates the SIM dynamically through Dependency Injection.
