### 🚀 Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to understand how Spring Boot automatically manages dependencies and injects objects using the @Autowired annotation.

It follows a simple real-life scenario where:

A Mobile depends on a SIM to make calls and use data.

The SIM interface has two implementations: Airtel and Jio.

The Mobile class activates the SIM dynamically through Dependency Injection.
